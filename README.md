# quotesapi-dotnet-mini2
simple minimal api that will have a persistent database, validation, and search (compared to #1)


**((currently in progeress))**


STILL WANT TO ADD:
- search endpoint that queries quote content and source
- make search endpoint target DTO instead of quote directly
- make a get timestamp endpoint that takes in id and targets quote directly
